cvtypes - A Python wrapper for OpenCV using ctypes
========================================================

cvtypes is a package that brings Intel's (now Willow Garage's) Open Source Computer Vision Library (OpenCV) to Python. OpenCV is a collection of algorithms and sample code for various computer vision problems. The goal of cvtypes is to provide Python access to all documented functionality of OpenCV.

Availability
============

   To get the latest version, see:
   http://code.google.com/p/cvtypes/

Requirements
============

The following packages must be installed on your platforms:
 - OpenCV 1.0 or above
 - Python 2.5 or above

cvtypes detects the existence of OpenCV installation by detecting OpenCV's shared libraries. It uses these shared libraries to provide an interface in Python. This is done via package 'ctypes' that is available in Python since version 2.5. 

Installation
============

Starting from version 0.3.0, cvtypes is distributed by using distutils. Simply type the following command to install the package:
python setup.py install

Support
-------

- Platforms: Win32, Linux, and Mac OS
- OpenCV version 1.0 and 1.1pre1

How to use
==========

See the demo package coming along with cvtypes. It contains many Python demos slightly modified from the Python and C++ demos of OpenCV. Compared to their demos, our demos are similar in syntax, but are shorter and more elegant.
